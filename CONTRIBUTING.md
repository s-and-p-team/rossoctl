# Contributing to this project

Greetings! We are grateful for your interest in joining the Rossoctl community and making a positive impact. Whether you're raising issues, enhancing documentation, fixing bugs, or developing new features, your contributions are essential to our success.

To get started, kindly read through this document and familiarize yourself with our code of conduct.

We can't wait to collaborate with you!

## Contributing Code

### Developer's Guide

Please follow our [Developer's Guide](./docs/_internal/dev-guide.md) where you can find comprehensive instructions
for common development operations.

### Prerequisites

Follow [installation](./docs/operate/install-kubernetes.md) instructions.

### Issues

Prioritization for pull requests is given to those that address and resolve existing GitHub issues. Utilize the available issue labels to identify meaningful and relevant issues to work on.

If you believe that there is a need for a fix and no existing issue covers it, feel free to create a new one.

As a new contributor, we encourage you to start with issues labeled as good first issues.

Your assistance in improving documentation is highly valued, regardless of your level of experience with the project.

To claim an issue that you are interested in, kindly leave a comment on the issue and request the maintainers to assign it to you.

Alternatively, comment `/claim` on the issue to have it automatically assigned to you. Issues labeled `blocked` or `in-progress` cannot be claimed this way.

### Committing

We encourage all contributors to adopt [best practices in git commit management](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/blog/telling-stories-with-your-git-history) to facilitate efficient reviews and retrospective analysis. Your git commits should provide ample context for reviewers and future codebase readers.

A recommended format for final commit messages is as follows:

```text
{Short Title}: {Problem this commit is solving and any important contextual information} {issue number if applicable}
```

### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request, clear communication is appreciated. This can be achieved by providing the following information:

- Detailed description of the problem you are trying to solve, along with links to related GitHub issues
- Explanation of your solution, including links to any design documentation and discussions
- Information on how you tested and validated your solution
- Updates to relevant documentation and examples, if applicable

The pull request template has been designed to assist you in communicating this information effectively.

Smaller pull requests are typically easier to review and merge than larger ones. If your pull request is big, it is always recommended to collaborate with the maintainers to find the best way to divide it.

See the [making PR](./docs/_internal/dev-guide.md#making-a-pr) document for detailed instructions.

Before a feature is accepted into a release it must meet the project's
[Feature Acceptance Standard](./FEATURE_ACCEPTANCE.md), a tiered bar covering code
quality, documentation, demonstrated value, and environment portability. The pull
request template walks you through the applicable checklist.

## Releasing

Maintainers: see the [Releasing Guide](./docs/_internal/releasing.md) for how to create
tags, pre-releases, and stable (GA) releases across the Rossoctl organization.

## Contributing Documentation

Documentation improvements are always welcome! This section is the authoritative standard for the
pages under `docs/`. It is for a code contributor and for a documentation contributor.

A documentation-only change is Tier 0 in the [Feature Acceptance Standard](./FEATURE_ACCEPTANCE.md).

A coding agent reads the same rules through the `meta:write-docs` skill. The skill points to this
section. Change this section first, and the agent follows.

### The two documentation sets

The repository holds two sets of Markdown. Each set has different rules. Find your set before you
write.

| Set | Location | Reader | Published to rossoctl.dev | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Product documentation** | `docs/<section>/` | A user of Rossoctl | Yes | This guide. Docusaurus frontmatter. No `#` title in the body. |
| **Internal documentation** | `docs/_internal/` | A contributor or a maintainer | No | Add `draft: true` to the frontmatter. Start the body with a `#` title. |

Everything below applies to the product documentation, unless a rule names `docs/_internal/`.

### Where content lives

Each section has one reader and one purpose. Put your page in the section that matches your reader.

| Section | Reader | What goes there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/get-started/` | A new user | A numbered procedure that gives a result in one sitting. |
| `docs/concepts/core/` | A user who asks how Rossoctl works | An explanation of a component that is Ready. |
| `docs/concepts/experiments/` | A user who evaluates a feature | An explanation of a feature that is Beta or Alpha. |
| `docs/workloads/` | A developer with agent code | How to put an agent or a tool on the platform. |
| `docs/security/` | A security reviewer | What the platform enforces, and where. |
| `docs/operate/` | A platform engineer | Installation, observability and diagnosis. |
| `docs/reference/` | A user who looks for one fact | A command, a field, a term. |

Files that are not pages:

| Content | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Screenshots, and diagrams from draw.io | `docs/images/` |
| Hand-authored SVG diagrams | `docs/images/`. See [SVG diagram style guide](./docs/_internal/svg-diagram-style-guide.md). |
| Mermaid source, and the generated PNG | `docs/diagrams/`. See [Diagrams](#diagrams). |
| A term that more than one page uses | `docs/reference/glossary.md` |

### Decide where your change goes

Use the first rule that applies.

1. **A page covers the subject.** Change that page. Do not add a second page for the same subject.
2. **No page covers the subject, and a section fits.** Add a page to that section. Give it a
   `sidebar_position` that puts it in reading order.
3. **The feature is an experiment.** Add the page to `docs/concepts/experiments/`. Add a row to the
   table in `docs/concepts/index.md`, with the status Beta or Alpha. Start the page with a
   `:::warning Alpha` callout.
4. **No section fits.** Open an issue. Do not add a section in the pull request. A new section needs a
   maintainer, an `_category_.json` file and a position for each other section.

#### If a section is missing and you cannot write it

Open an issue. Give three facts:

- The reader, from [PERSONAS_AND_ROLES.md](./PERSONAS_AND_ROLES.md).
- The question that the reader asks.
- The page, or the section, that must hold the answer.

Do not put a `TODO` in a page, and do not publish an empty heading. A reader who finds an empty
section reads it as an error in the product.

### Frontmatter

Every page under `docs/<section>/` starts with frontmatter.

```markdown
---
title: RossoCortex
description: See and understand what your AI agent sends — every model, tool and API call.
sidebar_position: 3
---
```

| Key | Required | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | Yes | The name of the page. The body has no `#` heading, because the title comes from this key. |
| `description` | Yes | One sentence. Say what the reader gets, not what the component is. |
| `sidebar_position` | Yes | The reading order inside the section. |
| `sidebar_label` | No | A shorter title for the sidebar. Use it when the title is long. |

### How to write

The pages follow ASD-STE100 (Simplified Technical English). The rules below are the rules that the
current pages keep. A reader who does not read English as a first language reads these pages, and a
translation tool reads them also.

- **One instruction in one sentence.** Keep a sentence to approximately 20 words.
- **Use the present tense.** Write "RossoCortex removes the definitions", not "will remove".
- **Use the active voice.** Write "The operator injects the sidecar", not "the sidecar is injected".
- **Write to the reader as "you".** Do not write "we".
- **Use one word for one meaning.** A tool is a tool on each page, not a "utility" or a "plugin".
- **Do not use a contraction.** Write "do not", not "don't".
- **Say what a thing does, and what it does not do.** A limit is information, not a weakness.

| Do not write | Write |
| --- | --- |
| Simply install the CLI. | Install the CLI. |
| Please note that the cost is an estimate. | The cost is an estimate. |
| It's easy to see the traffic. | `agentop observe` shows the traffic. |
| This will allow you to reduce tokens. | Two experimental plugins reduce the tokens. |
| We recommend a sidecar. | Use a sidecar on Kubernetes. |

#### Callouts

Use a Docusaurus callout. Do not use a blockquote for a callout.

| Callout | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `:::note` | Information that the reader can skip. |
| `:::warning Alpha` | The maturity of a feature, and a risk. |
| `:::info` | A reference to a different page. |
| `:::tip` | A shorter method that gives the same result. |

#### Headings

- Use a sentence, and capitalize the first word only: `## Before you start`.
- Number a procedure: `## Step 1: install the program`.
- Do not repeat the title of the page in the first heading.

### Accuracy rules

A wrong claim costs a reader more time than a missing page. Keep these four rules.

1. **A claim must agree with the page that it links to.** Read the target page, and use its words. In
   [#2564](https://github.com/rossoctl/rossoctl/pull/2564), a new introduction promised data on disk
   and a deletion command, and the page that it cited said the opposite.
2. **Do not document behaviour that is not released.** If a claim depends on an open issue, add a
   comment for the release that must confirm it:

   ```markdown
   <!-- VERIFY v0.9.0: confirm the local-only claim once persistence (#901, sqlite) lands. -->
   ```

3. **Give the maturity, and give the default.** A Beta or an Alpha feature needs a `:::warning`
   callout. If a plugin is off by default, write "off by default". See the maturity table in
   `docs/concepts/index.md`.
4. **Show the output that the reader sees.** Copy it from a terminal. Do not write it from memory.

### Links

- Link to a page with a relative path, and keep the `.md` extension:
  `[Read the numbers](./reading-the-numbers.md)`.
- An anchor is the heading in lower case, with a hyphen for each space: `#the-plugin-chain`.
- Open the target page and confirm that the heading is present. A heading changes more often than a
  file name.
- Give each link descriptive text. Do not write "here" or "this page".

### Page templates

#### Task page, for `docs/get-started/` and `docs/workloads/`

````markdown
---
title: <Do the task>
description: <The result that the reader gets.>
sidebar_position: <n>
---

<One paragraph: the result, and the time that the task needs.>

## Before you start

You need:

- <A prerequisite.>

## Step 1: <do the first action>

```bash
<one command>
```

<What the command changes.>

## Step 2: <do the second action>

## Next

- [<The page that follows>](<path>.md)
````

#### Concept page, for `docs/concepts/`

```markdown
---
title: <Component>
description: <What the reader gets from the component.>
sidebar_position: <n>
---

<One paragraph: what the component gives the reader. Not the architecture.>

## What you get

- **<A benefit>.** <One sentence.> See [<the detailed page>](<path>.md).

## Install it

<A pointer to the procedure. Do not repeat the procedure.>

## How it works

<The architecture. This is optional depth for the reader who wants it.>

## What <component> does not do

- <A limit.>

## Related pages

- [<A page>](<path>.md) <what it adds.>
```

#### Experiment page, for `docs/concepts/experiments/`

```markdown
---
title: <Feature>
description: <What the feature does.>
sidebar_position: <n>
---

<One paragraph: the problem, then the feature.>

:::warning Alpha
This feature is an experiment. The behaviour and the configuration will change.
:::

## The problem that it solves

## How it operates

## How to enable it

## What it does not do
```

#### Reference page, for `docs/reference/`

```markdown
---
title: <Command or resource>
description: <What the reader finds here.>
sidebar_position: <n>
---

<One sentence: the scope of the page.>

| <Name> | <Default> | <What it does> |
| --- | --- | --- |
```

### Diagrams

When adding diagrams to the documentation, please place them in the appropriate location:

- **General images and architecture diagrams**: Place PNG, JPG, or other image files in [`docs/images/`](./docs/images/). This includes architecture diagrams, screenshots, QR codes, and other visual assets used across the documentation. We recommend using [draw.io](https://draw.io) for generating diagrams so they can be easily edited in the future.

- **Mermaid sequence diagrams**: Place Mermaid source files (`.mmd`) in [`docs/diagrams/`](./docs/diagrams/) and generate PNG versions in [`docs/diagrams/images/png/`](./docs/diagrams/images/png/). See the [diagrams README](./docs/diagrams/README.md) for instructions on generating diagram images from Mermaid source files.

When referencing diagrams in documentation, use relative paths from the documentation file location (e.g., `./images/rossoctl-architecture.drawio.png` or `../diagrams/images/png/01-user-authentication-flow.png`).

### Check your change

Run both checks before you open the pull request. The Docs CI workflow runs the same two tools.

```bash
# 1. Markdown lint, with the configuration of the repository
npx markdownlint-cli2 "**/*.md"

# 2. Relative links in the files that you changed.
#    Install lychee first: brew install lychee (or cargo install lychee)
lychee --offline --config .lychee.toml \
  $(git diff --name-only --diff-filter=d main...HEAD -- '*.md')
```

The link check gates the files that your pull request changes. A broken relative link in a changed
file fails the job.

`.lychee.toml` excludes `docs/_internal/` and `.claude/`. A link in one of those files is not gated,
so open each target and confirm it by hand.

### Checklist

- [ ] The page is in the section that matches the reader.
- [ ] The frontmatter has `title`, `description` and `sidebar_position`.
- [ ] The body has no `#` heading.
- [ ] Each claim agrees with the page that it links to.
- [ ] A Beta or an Alpha feature has a `:::warning` callout, and the default is stated.
- [ ] Each link and each anchor resolves.
- [ ] Each code block has a language tag, and each command runs.
- [ ] `markdownlint-cli2` reports 0 issues.
- [ ] The pull request states the tier. A documentation-only change is Tier 0. See
      [FEATURE_ACCEPTANCE.md](./FEATURE_ACCEPTANCE.md).
